            <p>Hello! My name is Tony Barron, I am from Monterrey, Mexico. 
                I find joy in a variety of activities, including playing soccer, listening to music, spending quality time with my wife, learning new things, and watching movies.
                I've been married for two years, and we have a cat. We are contemplating adding another cat to our family so they can keep each other company.
                I am also studying Mechatronical Engineering at my local university. I'm really interested in technology because it can make a big difference in people's lives, 
                whether it's improving communication, making tasks easier, or creating new opportunities. I'm excited about the positive impact it can have on society.
                I'm really excited to start learning to code. I can't wait to see what I can create with it, like making my own websites. Exploring coding feels like unlocking 
                a whole new world of possibilities, and I'm eager to dive in and bring my ideas to life on the web.
